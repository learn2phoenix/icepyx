# Summary

icepyx is both a software library and a community composed of ICESat-2 (NASA satellite) data users, developers, maintainers, and the scientific community.
We are working together to develop a shared library of resources - including existing resources, new code, tutorials, and use-cases/examples - that simplify the process of querying, obtaining, analyzing, and manipulating ICESat-2 datasets to enable scientific discovery.

# Statement of need

icepyx aims to provide a clearinghouse for code, functionality to improve interoperability, documentation, examples, and educational resources that tackle disciplinary research questions while minimizing the amount of repeated effort across groups utilizing similar datasets.
icepyx also hopes to foster collaboration, open-science practices, and reproducible workflows by integrating and sharing resources.

The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) [@is2] was launched by NASA in September 2018.
The laser altimeter on board the satellite emits green light and measures the time until each pulse is returned to the satellite's sensors.
This information is used to determine the surface height of the land, ice, snow, trees, water, clouds, etc. that the satellite is passing over.
The instruments provide close to 500 GB of data per day, allowing scientists to investigate the surface height of earth's features in unprecedented detail.

icepyx began during the cryosphere-themed ICESat-2 Hackweek at the University of Washington in June 2019.
At the event, a clear need for a collaborative, shared community space that combined and generalized the tooling (including code and examples past, present, and future) written by Hackweek participants, ICESat-2 Science Team members, and the data user community.
This project combined and generalized the existing scripts into a unified framework, adding examples, documentation, and testing where necessary and making them accessible for everyone.
The library and community continue to grow and evolve, adding new features and building scientific literacy in open-science, cloud computing, and collaborative development practices.
icepyx is now a foundational tool for accessing and working with ICESat-2 data and is featured in multiple scientific publications[@Bisson:2021; @Fernando:2021; @Li:2020], presentations [@js2021agu; @js2020agu; @js2019agu], and educational events/Hackweeks [@2022_IS2-HW-tutorials; @2020_IS2-HW-tutorials].

# Acknowledgements

We acknowledge funding support from NASA and the University of Washington eScience Institute.
Anthony Arendt, Fernando Perez, Lindsey Heagey, and the Pangeo team provided invaluable support and guidance in establishing this library and welcoming us to the open-source community.
Amy Steiker, Mikala Beig, Nick Kotlinski, Luis Lopez, and many others at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) provide technical support and data access guidance.
The icepyx contributors list also includes many wonderful folks who shared ideas, provided mentoring, and embraced the opportunity to engage in open-science practices while working with ICESat-2 data products.
